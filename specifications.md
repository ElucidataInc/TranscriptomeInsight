# Specification for YAML Definitions

## Introduction
This document outlines the template for creating definitions in YAML format. Definitions are used to describe the structure and properties of various entities in a dataset or schema.

## YAML Structure
YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format. It uses indentation to represent the hierarchical structure of data. Definitions in YAML typically consist of a combination of keys and values, organized into a structured format.

## Template for Definitions
Below is the template for creating definitions in YAML:

```yaml
EntityName:
  description: >
    Description of the entity.
  properties:
    Property1:
      description: >
        Description of the property.
      type: DataType
      format: DataFormat (if applicable)
      pattern: RegularExpression (if applicable)
      additionalProperties: AdditionalProperties (if applicable)
      ...
    Property2:
      description: >
        Description of the property.
      type: DataType
      format: DataFormat (if applicable)
      pattern: RegularExpression (if applicable)
      additionalProperties: AdditionalProperties (if applicable)
      ...
    ...
  type: ObjectType
  version: VersionNumber
```

## Explanation

In the template provided:

- **EntityName**: Represents the name of the entity being defined. For example, if defining a "Person" entity, you would replace "EntityName" with "Person".
  
- **description**: Describes the entity being defined, providing information about its purpose and usage. This should be a concise but informative description.
  
- **properties**: Contains definitions for the properties of the entity. Each property is defined under this section.
  
- **Property1, Property2, ...**: Represents the names of properties associated with the entity. For example, for a "Person" entity, properties could include "name", "age", and "email".
  
- **description**: Provides a description for each property, explaining its purpose and usage.
  
- **type**: Specifies the data type of the property, such as string, number, object, or array.
  
- **format**: Indicates the format of the data, if applicable. For example, for an email property, the format could be specified as "email".
  
- **pattern**: Allows you to specify a regular expression pattern for the property, if needed.
  
- **additionalProperties**: This property allows you to specify additional properties for the entity, if applicable.
  
- **type**: Specifies the type of the entity, such as object.
  
- **version**: Specifies the version number of the definition.
